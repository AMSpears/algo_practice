// FIND CLOSEST VALUE IN BST

/** Write a function that takes in a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a Target Intenger value and returns the closes value to that target value contained in the BST.
 *
 * You can assume that there will only be one closest value.
 *
 * Each BST node has an integer value, a left child node and a right child node. A node is said to be a valid BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its
 right; and its children nodes are either valid BST nodes themsevels or None/null.
 *
 * tree =  10
 *     5        15
 *   2   5    13  22
 * 1         14
 * Target = 12
